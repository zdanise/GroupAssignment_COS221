DATABASE INTERPRETATIONS
1.We assume anyone is able to browse the GWS travels website freely however, certain types of users will gain certain privileges. For example Winery users would be able to access the winery catalogue 
if they are already verified by the GWS travel team.
If not, the Winery would be given an opportunity to send a request to join the GWS travels family, where the GWS team will go through some formalities that would ultimately verify the potential new Winery client.
With that said, verified Wineries would be able to add wines to their catalogue providing the new wine's name, age bottle size, wine type and wine image.
Customers (another type of user) will be able to make an order placement and even write reviews on the items they purchased.
For regular users that do not have an account can go as far as adding items to a cart however when they want to checkout/purchase they would first have to create an account making them a customer.

2. Reasons for Customer and User: A normal user as mentioned above, can freely explore the website but is limited to certain functionalities. We require the user to have an account for extra security reasons.
The user then becomes our customer. We will have extra personal information such as their phone number and address so that they can be reached in case of technicalities that can occur during a transaction, for example.

3.Different types of Wineries:Different wineries provide distinct services that they can offer. We separated these wineries to make it easier for the user to choose the right winery that suits their needs when they choose to visit. For example, a user might not 
just want to taste the wine the winery provides but the user might want to go to a restaurant that would serve their wine best with complementary food recommended by the winery itself. For more information on different wineries this can be viewed in the EER.
